Hi there! 😎✨

I am a PhD student in Education at the University of California, Irvine, advised by <a href = 'http://niadowell.com/'>Dr. Nia Nixon</a> and <a href ='https://markwarschauer.com/'>Dr. Mark Warschauer</a>. 
My research is at the intersection of <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">Learning Analytics</span>, <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">Artificial Intelligence</span>, and <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">Algorithm Fairness</span>. 


Specifically, I focus on:

  1. Building <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">machine learning </span>and <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">natural language processing (NLP) models</span> to understand how <span style="background-color: rgba(181, 9, 172, 0.05); color: #b509ac; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">students and AI interact</span>

  2. Addressing and mitigating <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">algorithmic biases</span> to promote <span style="background-color: rgba(181, 9, 172, 0.05); color: #b509ac; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">fairness</span> in education

  3. Developing <span style="background-color: rgba(181, 9, 172, 0.05); color: #b509ac; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">statistical and computational tools</span> for <span style="color: #b509ac; font-weight:bold;">learning analytics</span>.


I previously earned my MS in Learning Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Dr. David Williamson Shaffer at Epistemic Analytics lab and <a href='https://shamya.github.io/'> Dr. Shamya Karumbaiah</a> at Science of Ethically Augmented Learning lab. 

Before that, I earned BA in Education and BA in Statistics at Korea University.
